#### Chapter 1. Mission and Vision of the Democratic League

##### 1.1 Mission: Promote a System of Liquid Democracy
The mission of the Democratic League is to promote and implement a system of liquid democracy. This system combines elements of direct democracy and representative democracy, allowing citizens to participate directly in political decisions or delegate their voting power to trusted representatives, based on their preferences and expertise. It is important to note that in liquid democracy, citizens can delegate their vote for a specific area to someone and revoke this delegation at any time.

##### 1.2 Vision: A Socially Juster World through Liquid Democracy
The League firmly believes that a socially juster world where people can emancipate themselves is possible by replacing traditional representative democracy with a system of liquid democracy. This system would allow for increased citizen participation, better representation of popular interests, and strengthened democratic engagement and accountability.

### Chapter 3. Implementation of Liquid Democracy

##### 3.1 Gradual Implementation
The key element for the gradual implementation of liquid democracy rests on two fundamental principles:

- **Elected Officials' Commitment:** In any election, elected officials who declare themselves members of the Democratic League (DL) commit to applying the results of online votes for their personal decisions. This means that their official votes will reflect the preferences expressed by citizens via the liquid democracy platform.
- **Publication of Results:** Non-elected DL members publish the online voting results transparently. These publications will allow citizens to see how their opinions and votes are considered and if they are followed by representatives.

##### 3.2 Practical Steps for Implementation
- **Establishment of Online Voting Platforms:**
  - **Technological Development:** Design and develop secure, accessible, and user-friendly online voting platforms. Ensure complete transparency of the process and results.
  - **Testing and Improvements:** Launch pilot projects to test the platform and gather feedback. Use this feedback to refine and improve the platform.

- **Engagement of Candidates and Elected Officials:**
  - **Recruitment of Members:** Encourage candidates at all levels of elections to join the DL and commit to respecting the results of online votes.
  - **Awareness Campaigns:** Conduct awareness campaigns to inform voters about the commitment of candidates who are DL members and the importance of their participation in online votes.

- **Implementation of Publication Mechanisms:**
  - **Regular Publication:** Establish mechanisms for the regular publication of online voting results by non-elected DL members. Use online platforms, social media, and other communication channels to ensure wide dissemination.
  - **Transparency and Accessibility:** Ensure that online voting results are presented transparently, accessibly, and understandably to all citizens.

- **Citizen Education and Training:**
  - **Educational Programs:** Develop educational programs to train citizens in using online voting platforms and the importance of their participation.
  - **Educational Resources:** Provide educational resources such as guides, tutorials, and explanatory videos to help citizens familiarize themselves with the process.

### Chapter 4. Proposed Decision-Making Process in Liquid Democracy

##### 4.1 Introduction to the Decision-Making Process
This decision-making process in liquid democracy is an initial proposal. Like any rule, law, or regulation, it can be modified at any time by a majority vote. The only constitutive law of the Democratic League (DL) is that any law can be changed by a majority vote.

##### 4.2 Steps of the Decision-Making Process
- **Submission and Support of Proposals:**
  - **Submission of Proposals:** Any citizen can submit a decision or policy proposal. The proposal must include a clear description, the objectives aimed at, and the potential implications.
  - **Support for Proposals:** A proposal is scheduled for a vote only when a sufficient number of supports is obtained. Support can be delegated in the same way as a vote.
  - **Preliminary Analysis:** Before the vote, an evaluation of impacts and a budget estimate necessary for the implementation of the proposal are carried out.

- **Debate and Deliberation:**
  - **Discussion Space:** A discussion space is opened for each proposal, allowing citizens to discuss, ask questions, and debate the merits and shortcomings of the proposal.

- **Voting and Delegation:**
  - **Independence of Actions:** Voting and delegation are two independent actions. A citizen can delegate their vote in a domain to a person, but this delegation is done upstream of the votes. If a vote is underway, the delegation only becomes effective after the ongoing vote.
  - **Direct Vote:** Citizens can choose to vote directly on each proposal.
  - **Vote Delegation:** Citizens can also delegate their vote to a representative of their choice for one or more specific proposals.

- **Counting and Publication of Results:**
  - **Vote Counting:** At the close of the voting period, votes are counted transparently and securely.
  - **Publication of Results:** The results are published in an accessible manner to all citizens.

- **Implementation and Monitoring:**
  - **Implementation of Decisions:** Adopted decisions are implemented according to the results of online votes.
  - **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Regular monitoring is carried out to evaluate the impact of the decisions made and to gather feedback from citizens. The results of these evaluations are published to ensure continuous transparency.

This decision-making process in liquid democracy aims to enhance citizen participation, ensure transparent decision-making, and guarantee that citizens' voices are heard and respected. By combining direct voting and delegation mechanisms, we can create a more responsive, inclusive, and accountable democratic system.

### Chapter 5. How to Participate in the Democratic League

##### 5.1 Introduction to Participation
Liquid democracy relies on active participation and citizen engagement. This chapter details the various ways you can get involved and contribute to the implementation and functioning of liquid democracy.

##### 5.2 Becoming a Member of the Democratic League (DL)
- **Membership by Simple Will:**
  - **Member Declaration:** Becoming a member of the Democratic League (DL) is done by simply choosing to do so. Anyone can declare themselves a member of the DL. By declaring themselves a member, they express their adherence to the principles stated in this manifesto.
  - **No Mandatory Participation:** No specific participation is required to be a DL member, except for elected officials. Members are encouraged to participate actively, but this is not an obligation.

##### 5.3 Commitment of DL Elected Officials
- **Roles and Responsibilities of Elected Officials:**
  - **Informing Citizens:** DL elected officials commit to informing citizens about ongoing proposals and providing clear and transparent explanations about the issues of each proposal.
  - **Presenting Citizen Proposals:** Elected officials must present proposals submitted by citizens and bring them before decision-making bodies.
  - **Voting According to Citizen Results:** Elected officials commit to voting in accordance with the results of citizens' online votes. Their official vote will thus reflect the will expressed by citizens.
  - **Informing Other Elected Officials:** Elected officials must inform other elected officials (DL members or not) of citizen vote results, ensuring that the popular will is taken into account in political decisions.

##### 5.4 Participating in Votes and Deliberation
- **Direct Vote and Delegation:**
  - **Voting Directly:** Participate in online votes on proposals and important decisions. Every vote counts and helps shape policies and decisions.
  - **Vote Delegation:** If you prefer, you can delegate your vote to a trusted representative. This delegation can be done by specific domain and can be revoked at any time. Note that if a vote is underway, the delegation is only effective after that vote.

- **Submitting Proposals:**
  - **Citizen Proposals:** Submit your own proposals to be reviewed and voted on by the community. A proposal is scheduled for a vote when a sufficient number of supports is obtained. Support for a proposal can also be delegated.
  - **Preliminary Evaluation:** Once sufficient support is obtained, a preliminary evaluation is carried out to determine the impacts of the proposal and estimate the budget necessary for its implementation.

- **Participating in Discussions:**
  - **Discussion Spaces:** Engage in discussions and deliberations on proposals. This can be done in the form of public meetings, online debates, or other suitable formats.

##### 5.5 Contributing to Platform Development
- **Technological Development:** If you have skills in technological development, you can contribute to the development and improvement of the liquid democracy platform. Join the open-source project and participate in the various development phases.
- **Testing and Feedback:** Participate in pilot projects as a beta tester to test the platform and provide valuable

 feedback. Help identify issues and propose improvements.

##### 5.6 Awareness and Education
- **Educational Programs:** Contribute to the creation and dissemination of educational programs to train citizens in using the online voting platform and the importance of their participation.
- **Awareness Campaigns:** Become a DL ambassador by leading awareness campaigns in your community. Organize workshops, seminars, and information sessions to encourage active participation.
